# OpenVG
These are the official Khronos Group OpenVG headers for OpenVG 1.1.

The goal of this repository is not to contain code files, but only header files of the latest
OpenVG specification from the registry.

Additional modifications are to be provided in the VG/vgext.h file to support 3rd party extensions as well as
platform support in VG/vgplatform.h . These mods might not be official, but updates that will help people supporting
OpenVG with their renderer implementation.

Note: As maintainer for this github repo, I do not claim ownership of these headers. I'm not in the Khronos Group,
nor claim to be well versed in the arcane OpenVG arts. I just need this in GitHub, and thought it might be useful to others.
